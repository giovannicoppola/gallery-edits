        - label: <details><summary>Uses sensible keywords with several characters.</summary>Keywords which are too short can get lost amongst results or conflict with other workflows. While there are exceptions, workflow keywords (including in Script Filters, File Filters, or similar) should in general be at least three characters long. Ideally they will also be <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/advanced/keywords/#configurable">user-configurable</a>.</details>
